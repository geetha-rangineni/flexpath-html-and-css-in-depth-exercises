Exercise 15: CSS Combinators

Description: 

Replace the `<a href="about.html">Learn more about me</a>` html in your file
with a <nav> element. 

Inside of this <nav> element, create an unordered list of 3 separate list 
items. 

Inside of each list item, put an <a> tag that links out to the following html
pages:
- index.html 
- about.html
- contact.html

Then make the index.html link display as "Home", the about.html link as "About,
and the contact.html link as "Contact Me"

Then, use a descendant selector to style all <li> elements inside the 
<nav> element by setting their display to inline and adding some padding.

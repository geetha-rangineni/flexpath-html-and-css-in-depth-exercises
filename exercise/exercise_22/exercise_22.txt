Exercise 22: Understanding CSS Specificity

Description: 

Explain why an element with an 
inline style style="color: red;" will have red text even 
if an external CSS file sets the color to blue for that element.


Answer:

Inline styles have higher specificity than 
external stylesheets because they are applied directly to the element. 

The specificity hierarchy is:

- Inline styles (style attribute) â€“ Highest specificity.
- IDs (#id selectors).
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (.class, [type="text"], :hover).
- Elements and pseudo-elements (h1, ::after).


Therefore, the inline color: red; overrides the external CSS color: blue;.

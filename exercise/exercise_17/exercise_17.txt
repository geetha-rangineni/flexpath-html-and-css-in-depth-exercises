Exercise 17: Using Flexbox for Layout

Description: 

Create a navigation bar using Flexbox styling. 

Give the <nav> element a class of 'navbar'

Then in styles.css, use flexbox styling to arrange the links inside 
the <nav> element horizontally and space them evenly across the container
by justifying the content of the navbar and adding padding around each 
<a> tag.

Give the new navbar a dark grey background and make the link tags within
it white using css rules.
